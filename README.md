# Project-task
Objective of the Project

The purpose was to build basic task list. A user of app can add a task,  delete an already added task and clear all the task on the list. 
The user wil only be able to add a record if all the fields are completed. The task will added as a row at the end of the table.

Tasks:

1) Create an array that will hold all the values of the table. 

2) The first thing we need to do is set up an array where weâ€™ll place the todo list items. Each todo item will be an object with three properties: text, a string which holds whatever the user types into the text input, checked, a boolean which helps us know if a task has been marked completed or not, and id, a unique identifier for the item.
